# A Uber Clone project using Next.js. 

This project is aimed for beginners and has two main goals :  
  - Work with an external API.
  - Deploy the App in Vercel.

I worked on this project while watching this tutorial from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CleverProgrammer">Clever Programmer</a> in Youtube : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_VuGmykVgTg&t=2889s">Uber Clone with Next JS, React JS, Tailwind CSS and Firebase.</a>

I can't stress this enough guys, doing projects is by far the best way to get you started and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CleverProgrammer">Clever Programmer</a> has some really great content for early beginners !

## Before starting
As I said earlier, this project needs an external API. Can you guess why ?

Well, to develop a Uber Clone, we will need someone to provide us with some maps and <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> works wonders for what we are trying to implement.

So go ahead and Sign up to <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> (don't worry, we will only use the free version for this project).

Once your account is activated, you will be given an Access Token. the Default public token that <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> gives us is all we need. 


## How To Use
From your command line, clone and run Todo-list:

```
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/YKizou/Uber-Clone

# Go into the repository
$ cd Uber-Clone

# Install dependencies
$ yarn
```

Search for YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN and replace it with your actual token provided by <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a>.
"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" exists in four different locations inside the repo.

And finally :
```
# Run Project
$ yarn dev
```


## Deployment
When you are done with the setup, you can host your app online. I highly recommend you to read through the <a href="https://vercel.com/docs">Vercel</a> docs for deployment. It's super easy and you will have your first project online in few minutes !
